**`Trouble-Solver`**

I am a backend developer who loves to solve day to day problems and expand my knowledge. What motivated me to start programming is that I am also a private pilot and flight dispatcher, which led me to optimize processes to make the operation more efficient. As of today, my biggest project is Aerobot, a WhatsApp chatbot focused on providing aeronautical information quickly and efficiently.

### Aerobot

Aerobot is a project that seeks to have information just one message away. It is a chatbot for WhatsApp to help all actors in the aeronautical field to fly safer and be better informed. It is a project that marked my path as a developer since I started it when I started programming and it has led me to learn an impressive variety of technologies. Today it has more than 100 active monthly users and more than 500 messages per day. 

When you are in the air flying you don't always have the privilege of having a mobile signal and being able to access three or four different web pages to get a certain piece of information. Aerobot solves this problem, because with just one message you can get everything you need.

 <summary><h3>‚úà My journey</h3></summary>
   As much as it sounds like a joke, what sparked my spark for programming was Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas when I was young. At that time it was very popular to play its multiplayer version on servers, the famous SA:MP. The servers ran in a language called PAWNO and when I was 10 years old I liked to play around with the files and even encouraged myself to insert pieces of code and see what they did. I like to be efficient and solve real life problems with hard solutions. 

Years later I was finishing my studies as a flight dispatcher, where I encountered many tasks that required continuous calculation, weight and balance, runway calculations, and so on. It was at this point that I started programming seriously and my first project was a small calculator to solve these problems. From there, no one could stop me.

In this way I have learned many incredible technologies that have marked my path and motivate me daily to improve. I have a desire to grow and grow, it is what makes me happiest.
